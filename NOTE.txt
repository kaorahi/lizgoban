Note on design:

We try to avoid confirmation dialogs for any actions and enable "undo"
of them instead.  UI is kept modeless as far as possible.  See "humane
interface" for these points
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface).

Preferences are also kept as small as possible because they make
user-support difficult.  They also cause bugs that appear only in
specific preferences and such bugs are often overlooked by the
developers.

Note on implementation:

Leelaz is wrapped as if it is a stateless analyzer for convenience.
The wrapped leelaz receives the history of moves from the beginning to
the current board state for every analysis.  Only the difference from
the previous call is sent to leelaz internally for efficiency.

Handicap stones are treated as usual moves internally and the move
number is shifted only on the display.  We dare to do this from the
experience of repeated bugs on handicap games in Lizzie.

Endstate estimation (by ihavnoid's version) tends to oscillate between
black and white turns.  So we use the average of recent two moves for
score estimation and an even number for the width of endstate diff.
These are not applied to Katago as its estimation seems more stable.

src/package.json exists only for backward compatibility to enable "npx
electron src".

Note on confusing names (for historical reason):

is_black - used in game history like {move: "D4", is_black: true, ...}
black - used in stones (2D array) like {stone: true, black: true, ...}

endstate - 2D array (positive = black)
ownership - 1D array (positive = black)

move_count - handicap stones are also counted.
(First move = 1 in a normal game, 5 in a 4-handicap game.)
