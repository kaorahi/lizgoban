<h3>Board</h3>

Suggested moves
<ul>
 <li>color: winrate</li>
 <li>opacity: visits</li>
 <li>number: suggested order</li>
</ul>

<p>
You see yellow (normal), orange (bad), and red (very bad) circles usually.
When the opponent plays a bad move, you will see cyan (very good) and
green (good) circles.
Small triangles are minor suggestions.
Small red circles are next candidates that are not searched yet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Mouse">Mouse controls:</a>
<ul>
 <li>click: put a stone</li>
 <li>hover on a suggested move: show the principal variation
      <ul>
       <li>A red X mark in the variation indicates that it is updated in the background and AI suggests another move (diamond mark) now.</li>
       <li>Push and release any "no effect" key, e.g. Ctrl, to update the displayed variation.</li>
      </ul>
 </li>
 <li>right-click: put the same color stone as the previous move (may be deleted in future)</li>
 <li>click on a stone: temporarily show the past board</li>
 <li>double-click on a stone: jump to the move</li>
 <li>Alt+drag: restrict analysis region (Alt+click: cancel region)</li>
 <li>Ctrl+Shift+click: edit moves in the middle of the game
      <ul>
       <li>(on an empty point) insert the move</li>
       <li>(on a stone) delete the move</li>
      </ul>
 </li>
 <li>b+click or w+click: as above with fixed color</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Branches:
<ul>
 <li>dotted square: branch (= child node)</li>
 <li>dotted triangle: branch at the previous move (= brother node)</li>
</ul>
You can preview branches by pushing the keys "b", "d", ... that correspond to the tag letters in the above marks (keep holding down). In this preview, you can hit Enter key to expand the branch on another trial board. Mouse click on the dotted square also triggers the latter action.
</p>

<p>
When the best suggested move is different from the previously expected one,
they are marked as red and blue squares respectively
so that you can notice the change of engine's opinion.
Black/white corner of the square indicates the plan of black/white.
They also appear in displayed variations.
This is especially useful when you are watching AI vs. AI, e.g.
"Black expects an extension after 8 moves, but white is planning a cut!"
(See "Alternative weights for white" in "Engine" menu and "AI vs. AI" in "Tool" menu. See also <a href="#side-by-side">Side by side comparison</a> for detailed display.)
</p>

<p>
You can also select "Lizzie style" in "View" menu
(top number = winrate, bottom number = visits).
The top number is replaced with the score if you use KataGo and check "Score bar" in "View" menu.
</p>

<p>
(Experimental: ladder display)
When you play a few (at least two) ladder moves successively,
possible ladder breakers are marked as "=".
Push "=" key (keep holding down) to preview the continuation of the ladder.
Hit Enter key to play it on another trial board in this preview.
Once you have seen a ladder by "=" key,
you can push "=" key again whenever you want to retry the same ladder on a different board situation (without "=" mark).
Note that the ladder detector is very cheap at present
and non-ladder moves can be wrongly detected occasionally.
</p>

<h3>Winrate bar</h3>

<ul>
 <li>black/white area: winrate of the current board</li>
 <li>green/red rectangle: change of winrate by the last move (green = good, red = bad)</li>
 <li>triangles: evaluations of suggested next moves (height = visits, size = prior probability, blue = next move)</li>
 <li>empty triangle of opposite direction: evaluation of the last move (before it was played)
 <li>gray number: visits of the most visited suggestion (= top of winrate bar)</li>
 <li>gray curves: trails of evaluations through the progress of the search process</li>
</ul>

Push "x" key (keep holding down) to enlarge winrate bar.
See also "Expand winrate bar" in "View" menu.
In the large winrate bar,
orange circles indicate recent visits (analysis efforts) of suggested moves,
slant orange lines indicate PUCT (analysis priorities)
(x-axis = PUCT, y-axis = predicted future position by current winrate + PUCT),
and horizontal orange lines indicate LCB (criterion for suggestion order).

<h3>Winrate graph</h3>

Main curve: winrate of black
<ul>
 <li>green segment: good move (increase winrate)</li>
 <li>red segment: bad move (decrease winrate)</li>
 <li>yellow segment: unexpected good move that was missed by engine</li>
 <li>yellow vertical line: evaluation error (difference between evaluations of the move before/after it was played)</li>
 <li>thin purple segments: estimations by other engines</li>
</ul>

Additional plots [K = KataGo only]:
<ul>
 <li>orange dots: estimated score of black [K]</li>
 <li>green / pink steps: cumulative score loss [K]</li>
 <li>red dots: ambiguity of stones (low for 100% alive or 100% dead) [K]</li>
 <li>alternating circles at the top: ko fights (o/x = resolved by connection/capture)</li>
 <li>rainbow bar at the middle: played zones (left = purple, center = white, etc.)</li>
 <li>rainbow square beside the graph: zone color map</li>
</ul>

Click / drag on the graph to go to the corresponding move.
Push "x" key (keep holding down) to enlarge winrate graph and zone color map.
Push "c" key (keep holding down) and hover the mouse on the graph
to show past / future boards temporarily.

When you are watching AI vs. AI, green and pink curves indicate
estimated winrates by the black and white engines, respectively.

<h3>Window title</h3>

Engine names and other information are shown in the window title. "!" after engine names indicate "aggressive mode" for handicap games (KataGo only).

<h3>Comments</h3>

The comment on the last move is shown below the winrate graph and buttons.
Click it to view the entire texts (and copy it to the clipboard) when it is long.
Use "Info" in "Edit" menu to edit them.

<h3>Visits graph</h3>

Another graph of visits progress is shown small
at the right bottom corner of the window
in <a href="#layout">landscape layout</a>.
Select "double_boards" in "View" menu and push "x" key
to view it in full size.

<ul>
 <li>x-axis: total visits</li>
 <li>y-axis: visits of each suggested move</li>
 <li>dotted curve: next move</li>
 <li>thick segment: best move</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other marks on the board</h3>

See <a href="#Katago">KataGo</a> section.

<hr>

<h2><a name="Tips">Tips</a></h2>

<h3>Convenient keys</h3>

Even if you prefer mouse / touchpad control, the four keys <a href="#ZXCKey">"z", "x", "c"</a>, and "v" (at the left bottom of the keyboard) will be worth using frequently. Try pushing each of them and watch the change of the board view while you keep holding it down. Note that <a href="#VKey">"v" key</a> works only for KataGo.

<h3><a name="TrialBoard">Trial board</a></h3>

A new board is created when you try to modify an existing game.
The border color of this board indicates that it is a "trial" board;
you can delete it quickly by <a href="#Boards">"q" key</a> (undelete: Ctrl+z).
Uncheck "trial board" in "Edit" menu to turn it to a normal board.
You can use "Ctrl + click" instead of "click" to play a move
in a new trial board.

<h3>Drag and drop</h3>

You can drag &amp; drop SGF files, URLs, or diagram images onto LizGoban to open them.

<h3>Recover lost boards</h3>

"Undelete board" in Edit menu works across sessions.
Try Ctrl+z to recover lost boards after unintentional quit.

<h3>Play against (weakened) engine</h3>

The simplest way is "Match vs. AI" in "File" menu.

<ul>
 <li>weak n: n=1 (slightly weak) to n=9 (very weak)</li>
 <li>-Xpt (KataGo only): lose the score by X points or so in every move</li>
</ul>

Note that strong engines may not find bad moves unless you give them sufficient time.
You can skip the rest of this section if the above menu is enough for you.

<p>
<ol>
 <li>Select "Raw board" in "View" menu.</li>
 <li>Click any point in your turn.</li>
 <li>Hit Enter key in engine's turn.<br>
      Or, hit "1", "2", ..., "9" key
      (1 = slightly weak move, 9 = very weak move).<br>
      Or, hit "0" key (play pass when there is enough margin of winrate).</li>
</ol>
Push "z" key (keep holding down) to peek suggestions.
</p>

<p>
As another handicap,
you can also play against a random mixture of different engines.
<ol>
 <li>Select "Raw board" in "View" menu.</li>
 <li>Select a weights file (ex. LZ38) from "Load network weights" in "Engine" menu.</li>
 <li>Select another weights file (ex. LZ157) from "Alternative weights for white" in "Engine" menu.</li>
</ol>
Then LZ157 is used normally for white if you hit Enter key.
But, if you hit "1" key, LZ38 is used instead for white with 10% probability.
It is 20% by "2" key, 30% by "3" key, ..., and 90% by "9" key.
</p>

<h3><a name="layout">UI layout</a></h3>

(You can switch landscape / portrait layout by changing window size at present.
But the latter is no longer maintained and will be removed in future versions.)

<h3><a name="letmethink">Let-me-think-first mode</a></h3>

If you select "Let me think first" in "View" menu,
LizGoban shows the plain board from 0% to 50% progress
and suggestions from 50% to 100%
for "Auto replay" or "AI vs. AI" in "Tool" menu.
Use <a href="#Tab">Tab key</a> to switch the view style manually.
Hit <a href="#semicolon">";" key</a> repeatedly to imitate
let-me-think-first style without autoplay.

<h3>Personal exercise book</h3>

<p>
In [Tool] menu, use [Store as exercise] to remember the current board and [Exercise] to show one of the stored boards randomly.
Push "stop match" button to exit from match mode.
(Hit Tab or Z key after it if analysis are not shown.)
</p>

<p>
Use "+" "-" buttons beside the star mark to modify the frequency of the current exercise.
</p>

<h3>Import diagram images</h3>

<p>
You can copy a diagram image and paste it onto LizGoban by Ctrl+V (Edit > Paste) or drag &amp; drop to import the positions of the stones.
</p>

<p>
This is very low-tech. You may need parameter tuning or manual correction for photographic/reflective images and marked/numbered/glossy stones. But it is still usable for many tsumego pictures on the Internet and many YouTube screenshots.
</p>

<h3>Tsumego frame for solving life &amp; death problems (experimental)</h3>

This feature is just an experiment. Do not expect much.

<ol>
 <li>Put stones of a problem. Use right-click to put same color stones.</li>
 <li>Select "Tool > Experimental > Tsumego frame" to fill rest areas.</li>
 <li>Start analysis (space key) and watch suggestions.</li>
</ol>

See <a href="#Mouse">Mouse controls</a> for analysis region.

<!--
<h3>Backward scan in auto-analysis</h3>

There is a
<span class="ext" data-url="https://github.com/kaorahi/leela-zero/tree/ladder_revtrans">modified Leela Zero</span>
that do not forget promising moves after undo.
Replace leelaz with it and
set auto analysis visits as a negative value for backward analysis
(scan from the last move to the first move)
to get possibly better evaluations when some moves are in "blind spots" of Leela Zero.

<h2><a name="Katago">KataGo</a></h2>

<p>
When you are using KataGo, you will find "Score bar" and "Ownership" in "View" menu.
Estimated ownership of each grid is shown as translucent black / white backgrounds
if "Ownership" is turned on.
The standard deviation of ownership is also shown as red backgrounds in the subboard If you select "Two boards A (main+PV)" or "Two boards D (raw+PV)" in "View" menu. It looks like a heatmap of "KataGo's eye tracking".
</p>

<p>
In addition, bogus territory counts (= sums of ownerships)
of black / white clusters are shown as
translucent green / pink numbers on the board.
They are calculated as follows:
<ul>
 <li>Only the ownerships on empty grids (and dead stones) are summed up for each cluster. Boundaries between black and white areas are excluded from this sum.</li>
 <li>Compensation for the estimated total score is shown as "+n" at the right top corner on the board. Ideally, it is equal to the difference of living stones in area-counting or the difference of captured stones in territory counting at the end of the game.</li>
</ul>
So they are not the correct "territories" because (1) future stones are
not considered and (2) neutral points (dame) are also counted.
Smaller fonts are used for the sums of very low ownerships on broad areas.
</p>

<p>
Bad moves are marked with triangles on stones (red = -5 pts, purple = -2 pts). Their thickness indicate if they were actually punished. Push "c" key (keep holding down) and click the stone to jump to the corresponding move. Push "<" or ">" to check such blunders one by one.
</p>

<p>
Small green squares and pink Xs on the board denote increase of black and white possibilities by recent moves. Push "/" key (keep holding down) to peek the board before these "recent moves".
</p>

<p>
<a name="VKey">Push</a> "v" key (keep holding down) to peek the boundary of each cluster and the ownership (10=100%, 9=90%, ...) on each grid. Use "v" + mouse hover (on the main board or on the winrate graph) to compare them with the past ones at a specified move if available.
</p>

<p>
The estimated score is plotted by orange dots in the winrate graph. The start of "recent moves" is shown by "/" tag there. Use "c" key (keep holding down) + mouse hover to view the change of ownerships from a specified move.
</p>

<p>
When the suggested variation is shown, inevitability of each move is indicate by its font size. The visits of each move is also indicated along the right edge of the board. The height of the letter n corresponds to the relative visits of the n-th move. The red number at the right top corner is the visits of the first move.
