LizGoban is an analysis tool of the game Go with
<span class="ext" data-url="https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero">Leela Zero</span>
and
<span class="ext" data-url="https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo">KataGo</span>.

<h3>Suggested moves on the board</h3>

<ul>
 <li>color: winrate</li>
 <li>opacity: visits</li>
 <li>number: suggested order</li>
</ul>

<p>
You see yellow (normal), orange (bad), and red (very bad) circles usually.
When the opponent plays a bad move, you will see cyan (very good) and
green (good) circles.
Small red circles are next candidates that are not searched yet.
</p>

<p>
Mouse operations:
<ul>
 <li>click: put a stone</li>
 <li>hover on a suggested move: show the principal variation</li>
 <li>right-click: put the same color stone as the previous move</li>
 <li>click on a tagged stone: go to this move</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When the best suggested move is different from the previously expected one,
they are marked as red and blue squares respectively
so that you can notice the change of engine's opinion.
Black/white corner of the square indicates the plan of black/white.
They also appear in displayed variations.
This is especially useful when you are watching AI vs. AI, e.g.
"Black expects an extension after 8 moves, but white is planning a cut!"
(See "Alternative weights for white" in "Engine" menu and "AI vs. AI" in "Tool" menu.)
</p>

<p>
You can also select "Lizzie style" in "View" menu
(top number = winrate, bottom number = visits).
</p>

<h3>Winrate bar</h3>

<ul>
 <li>black/white area: winrate of the current board</li>
 <li>green/red rectangle: change of winrate by the last move (green = good, red = bad)</li>
 <li>triangles: evaluations of suggested next moves (height = visits, size = prior probability, blue = next move)</li>
 <li>empty triangle of opposite direction: evaluation of the last move (before it was played)
 <li>gray number: visits of the best suggestion (= top of winrate bar)</li>
 <li>gray curves: trails of evaluations through the progress of the search process</li>
</ul>

Push "x" key (keep holding down) to enlarge winrate bar.
See also "Expand winrate bar" in "View" menu.
In the large winrate bar,
orange circles indicate recent visits (analysis efforts) of suggested moves,
slant orange lines indicate PUCT (analysis priorities)
(x-axis = PUCT, y-axis = predicted future position by current winrate + PUCT),
and horizontal orange lines indicate LCB (criterion for suggestion order).

<h3>Winrate graph</h3>

Main curve:
<ul>
 <li>green segment: good move (increase winrate)</li>
 <li>red segment: bad move (decrease winrate)</li>
 <li>yellow segment: unexpected good move that was missed by engine</li>
 <li>yellow vertical line: evaluation error (difference between evaluations of the move before/after it was played)</li>
 <li>thin purple segments: estimations by other engines</li>
</ul>

Additional plots [K = KataGo only]:
<ul>
 <li>orange horizontal line: komi [K]</li>
 <li>orange dots: estimated score without komi [K]</li>
 <li>green / pink steps: cumulative score loss [K]</li>
 <li>red dots: ambiguity of stones (low for 100% alive or 100% dead) [K]</li>
 <li>gray dots: unsafe (or dead) stones (edged = black, filled = white) [K]</li>
 <li>alternating circles at the top: ko fights</li>
 <li>rainbow bar at the bottom: played zones (left = purple, center = white, etc.)</li>
 <li>rainbow square beside the graph: zone color map</li>
</ul>

Click / drag on the graph to go to the corresponding move.
Push "x" key (keep holding down) to enlarge winrate graph and zone color map.
Push "c" key (keep holding down) and hover the mouse on the graph
to show past / future boards temporarily.

When you are watching AI vs. AI, green and pink curves indicate
estimated winrates by the black and white engines, respectively.

<h3>Comments</h3>

The comment on the last move is shown below the winrate graph and buttons.
Click it to view the entire texts when it is long.
Use "Info" in "Edit" menu to edit them.

<h3>Visits graph</h3>

Another graph of visits progress is shown small
at the right bottom corner of the window
in <a href="#layout">landscape layout</a>.
Select "double_boards" in "View" menu and push "x" key
to view it in full size.

<ul>
 <li>x-axis: total visits</li>
 <li>y-axis: visits of each suggested move</li>
 <li>dotted curve: next move</li>
 <li>thick segment: best move</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other marks on the board</h3>

See <a href="#Katago">KataGo</a> section.

<hr>

<h2><a name="Tips">Tips</a></h2>

<h3><a name="TrialBoard">Trial board</a></h3>

A new board is created when you try to modify an existing game.
The border color of this board indicates that it is a "trial" board;
you can delete it quickly by <a href="#Boards">"q" key</a> (undelete: Ctrl+z).
Uncheck "trial board" in "Edit" menu to turn it to a normal board.
You can use "Ctrl + click" instead of "click" to play a move
in a new trial board.

<h3>Drag and drop</h3>

You can drag &amp; drop SGF files or URLs onto LizGoban to open them.

<h3>Handicap stones</h3>

Handicap stones are not supported.
You can only imitate them by passes for white ("New handicap game" in "File" menu).
Note that komi is still fixed to 7.5 in Leela Zero.
For free placement,
right-click puts the same color stone as the previous move conveniently.

<h3>Play against (weakened) engine</h3>

<p>
<ol>
 <li>Select "Raw board" in "View" menu.</li>
 <li>Click any point in your turn.</li>
 <li>Hit Enter key in engine's turn.<br>
      Or, hit "1", "2", ..., "9" key
      (1 = slightly weak move, 9 = very weak move).<br>
      Or, hit "0" key (play pass when there is enough margin of winrate, Leela Zero only).</li>
</ol>
Push "z" key (keep holding down) to peek suggestions.
</p>

<p>
As another handicap,
you can also play against a random mixture of different engines.
<ol>
 <li>Select "Raw board" in "View" menu.</li>
 <li>Select a weights file (ex. LZ38) from "Load network weights" in "File" menu.</li>
 <li>Select another weights file (ex. LZ157) from "Alternative weights for white" in "Engine" menu.</li>
</ol>
Then LZ157 is used normally for white if you hit Enter key.
But, if you hit "1" key, LZ38 is used instead for white with 10% probability.
It is 20% by "2" key, 30% by "3" key, ..., and 90% by "9" key.
</p>

<h3><a name="layout">UI layout</a></h3>

You can switch landscape / portrait layout by changing window size.
See also "View" menu in LizGoban.

<h3><a name="letmethink">Let-me-think-first mode</a></h3>

If you select "Let me think first" in "View" menu,
LizGoban shows the plain board from 0% to 50% progress
and suggestions from 50% to 100%
for "Auto replay" or "AI vs. AI" in "Tool" menu.
Use <a href="#Tab">Tab key</a> to switch the view style manually.
Hit <a href="#semicolon">";" key</a> repeatedly to imitate
let-me-think-first style without autoplay.

<h3>Personal exercise book</h3>

In [Tool] menu, use [Store as exercise] to remember the current board and [Exercise] to show one of the stored boards randomly.
Hit Tab or Z key to show its analysis.

<!--
<h3>Backward scan in auto-analysis</h3>

There is a
<span class="ext" data-url="https://github.com/kaorahi/leela-zero/tree/ladder_revtrans">modified Leela Zero</span>
that do not forget promising moves after undo.
Replace leelaz with it and
set auto analysis visits as a negative value for backward analysis
(scan from the last move to the first move)
to get possibly better evaluations when some moves are in "blind spots" of Leela Zero.

<h2><a name="Katago">KataGo</a></h2>

<p>
When you are using KataGo, you will find "Komi" in "Tool" menu and "Score bar" in "View" menu.
</p>

<p>
You will also find "Endstate" in "View" menu.
Estimated ownership of each grid is shown as translucent black / white backgrounds
if this menu is turned on.
</p>

<p>
In addition, bogus territory counts (= sums of ownerships)
of black / white clusters are shown as
translucent green / pink numbers on the board.
They are calculated as follows:
<ul>
 <li>Only the ownerships on empty grids (and dead stones) are summed up for each cluster.</li>
 <li>Ownerships of living stones are summed up separately and their total difference of black and white is shown as "+n" at the right top corner on the board.</li>
</ul>
So they are not the correct "territories" because (1) future stones are
not considered and (2) neutral points (dame) are also counted.
Smaller fonts are used for the sums of very low ownerships on broad areas.
</p>

<p>
Small green squares and pink Xs on the board denote increase of black and white possibilities by recent moves. Push "/" key (keep holding down) to peek the board before these "recent moves".
</p>

<p>
Push "v" key (keep holding down) to peek the boundary of each cluster and the ownership (10=100%, 9=90%, ...) on each grid. Use "v" + mouse hover (on the board or on the winrate graph) to compare them with the past ones at a specified move if available.
</p>

<p>
The estimated score without komi is plotted by orange dots in the winrate graph. The start of "recent moves" is shown as the larger orange dot there. Use "c" key (keep holding down) + mouse hover to view the change of endstates from a specified move.
</p>
